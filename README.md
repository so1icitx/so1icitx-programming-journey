## About

Welcome to my **so1icitx Journey** repository! This space is dedicated to sharing projects and experiments I've worked on while learning new skills. Here, you'll find code samples, project snapshots, and learning notes primarily focused on:

- **Programming** (Python, C#, Solidity)
- **Cyber Security**

I created this repository as a personal log of my progress and as a way to share insights and solutions with others who might be on a similar journey.

## Projects

Feel free to browse through the different projects:
- **Python Projects:** Automation scripts, data analysis tools, web scraping utilities, and more.
- **C# Projects:** Desktop applications, game development experiments, and various other projects.
- **Cyber Security Projects:** Penetration testing scripts, vulnerability analysis tools, and security automation utilities.

Each project folder includes its own README with specific instructions, dependencies, and usage notes.

## Technologies

This repository leverages several programming languages and tools:

- **Python** for automation, data analysis, and scripting.
- **C#** for application development.
- **Solidity** for blockchain/smart contract experiments.
- **Cyber Security Tools** and scripts (detailed in individual project folders).

*(Consider adding a Cyber Security badge if you find one that fits.)*
